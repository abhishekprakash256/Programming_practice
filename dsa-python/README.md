# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python. It is designed to provide an accessible, well-documented, and easy-to-understand collection of common data structures and algorithms.


## Introduction

This project aims to help developers and students understand and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python. It includes explanations, visualizations (if applicable), and code for each structure/algorithm to facilitate learning and reference.

The repository is organized into folders corresponding to different categories of data structures and algorithms. You can explore them to see their implementations, or you can use them directly in your own projects.

## Data Structures

This section contains implementations of various data structures in Python:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Trees** (Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
- **Graphs**
- **Heaps**

## Algorithms

This section contains implementations of common algorithms:

- **Sorting Algorithms** (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- **Searching Algorithms** (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- **Graph Algorithms** (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, etc.)
- **Dynamic Programming** (Fibonacci, Knapsack, etc.)
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Divide and Conquer**

## Usage

To use any of the data structures or algorithms in this repository, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhishekprakash256/dsa-python.git
```

Then navigate to the relevant directory and run the Python script that corresponds to the data structure or algorithm you'd like to test.

Example:

```bash
cd sorting
python bubble_sort.py
```
