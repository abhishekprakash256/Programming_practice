# Python Playground

Welcome to **Python Playground**! This repository is a collection of Python code that covers everything from the basics of Python to advanced data structures, algorithms, and testing practices. It’s designed to help you learn and practice Python in an organized manner, with clear examples and explanations for each topic.


## Introduction

This repository contains code and examples organized into different folders, each focusing on a different aspect of Python programming. It serves as a learning and reference resource for anyone interested in Python, whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your knowledge in specific areas.

### The repository is structured as follows:
1. **Python Basics** - Learn fundamental Python syntax and features.
2. **Data Structures & Algorithms** - Implementations of various data structures and algorithms.
3. **Testing in Python** - Best practices for testing Python code with popular libraries.

## Python Basics

The **Python Basics** folder contains code examples that explain the fundamental concepts of Python, such as:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries, etc.
- **Control Flow**: if-else, loops (for, while), and conditional expressions.
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions, arguments, and return values.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Modules and Packages**: Importing libraries and organizing Python code.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.
- **Error Handling**: Try-except blocks and custom exceptions.

## Data Structures & Algorithms

This folder contains Python implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. Each data structure is implemented in its own Python file with explanations and basic operations.

### Data Structures:

- **Arrays**: Basic operations, searching, sorting.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list.
- **Stacks**: Push, pop, peek, and stack operations.
- **Queues**: Queue operations, circular queue.
- **Hash Tables**: Hashing techniques and collision handling.
- **Trees**: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Traversals (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order).
- **Graphs**: Representation, Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS).
- **Heaps**: Min-Heap, Max-Heap, heap operations.

### Algorithms:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Kruskal’s Algorithm, Prim’s Algorithm.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci, Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Coin Change, Activity Selection Problem.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort.

## Testing in Python

Testing is an essential part of software development, and Python provides several tools for testing your code. This folder contains examples of different testing methodologies in Python:

- **Unit Testing**: Using Python’s built-in `unittest` library.
- **Integration Testing**: Combining units to test as a whole.
- **Mocking**: Using `unittest.mock` to simulate objects and behavior.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before code.
- **Pytest**: Using the popular testing framework `pytest`.

Each testing file demonstrates basic use cases and advanced techniques to test Python applications.
